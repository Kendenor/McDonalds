## How to Test the Fixes

### Testing Referral Bonus System

1. **Ensure All Users Have Referral Codes:**
   - Go to Admin Dashboard → Users
   - Click "Ensure Referral Codes" button
   - Verify all users now have referral codes

2. **Test Referral Registration:**
   - Register a new user with a referral code
   - Verify the user gets the welcome bonus
   - Check that the referrer is properly linked

3. **Test First Deposit Referral Bonus:**
   - Make a first deposit for a referred user
   - Approve the deposit in admin panel
   - Check console logs for referral bonus processing
   - Verify referrer receives the bonus (19% of deposit amount)
   - Check level 2 and 3 referrers receive their bonuses (2% and 1% respectively)

4. **Use Debug Tools:**
   - Go to `/admin/debug-referral`
   - Enter a user ID and deposit amount
   - Click "Test Referral Bonus" to manually test
   - Check console for detailed logs

### Testing Password Change System

1. **Test Admin Password Change:**
   - Go to Admin Dashboard → Users
   - Find a user and click "Change Password"
   - Enter a new password
   - Verify the user receives a notification

2. **Test Login with Admin-Changed Password:**
   - Try logging in with the admin-changed password
   - If it works, the password was synced with Firebase
   - If it fails, the user should see a clear error message

3. **Test Normal Login:**
   - Users should still be able to login with their original passwords
   - Admin-changed passwords should work as a backup

## Referral Bonus Structure

- **Level 1 (Direct Referrer):** 19% of first deposit amount
- **Level 2 (Referrer's Referrer):** 2% of first deposit amount  
- **Level 3 (Referrer's Referrer's Referrer):** 1% of first deposit amount

**Important Notes:**
- Bonuses are only paid on **first deposits**
- Subsequent deposits do not trigger referral bonuses
- All bonuses are paid immediately when deposit is approved
- Users must have referral codes for the system to work

## Troubleshooting

### If Referral Bonuses Aren't Working:

1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Ensure all users have referral codes
3. Verify the user has a `referredBy` field
4. Check that `hasDeposited` is false for first deposits
5. Use the debug page to test manually

### If Password Changes Aren't Working:

1. The admin password change is stored in user data
2. Users should try the new password first
3. If it doesn't work, they may need to reset their password normally
4. Check that the user received the password change notification

## Console Logs to Watch For

When processing referral bonuses, you should see:
```
Processing referral bonus for first deposit: [amount]
Level 1 bonus: [amount] for referrer: [email]
Level 1 referral bonus processed successfully
Level 2 bonus: [amount] for referrer: [email]
Level 2 referral bonus processed successfully
Level 3 bonus: [amount] for referrer: [email]
Level 3 referral bonus processed successfully
```

If you see "Not first deposit, skipping referral bonus", that's expected behavior for subsequent deposits.
